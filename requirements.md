Problem Statement
Students struggle with revising large notes; manual flashcards are slow, smart tools are complex

Objective
"Develop a web tool to generate interactive flashcards from notes using AI for quick revision.”

Core Functionalities:
    Text input → AI generates 3-5 Q&A flashcards (T5/Gemini).
    Interactive UI (grid layout, “Show Answer”).
    Export to PDF (placeholder for now).


Optional: PDF input (future scope).

Future Scope: Voice input, spaced repetition, multi-language, gamified quiz.

Innovation: AI + EdTech combo, simple UX, PDF export potential.
